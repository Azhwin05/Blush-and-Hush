# How to Run on Mobile

1.  **Install Expo Go**:
    -   **Android**: Download [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) from the Google Play Store.
    -   **iOS**: Download [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) from the App Store.

2.  **Connect to Wi-Fi**:
    -   Ensure your mobile device and your computer are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.

3.  **Scan QR Code**:
    -   Check the terminal where `npx expo start` is running.
    -   **Android**: Open Expo Go and tap "Scan QR Code". Scan the QR code shown in the terminal.
    -   **iOS**: Open the default Camera app and scan the QR code. Tap the notification to open in Expo Go.

4.  **Troubleshooting**:
    -   If it doesn't connect, try pressing `s` in the terminal to switch to "Expo Go" mode if it's not already.
    -   If you are on different networks, press `t` in the terminal to enable "Tunnel" mode (may be slower).
